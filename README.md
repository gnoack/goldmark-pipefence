# goldmark-pipefence

A Goldmark extension for transforming ("piping") Markdown fenced code
blocks to HTML, by means of a []byte-to-[]byte transformation
function.

Some of the code in this package is based on
[goldmark-pikchr](https://github.com/gopikchr/goldmark-pikchr) by
Zellyn Hunter, which is in turn based on
github.com/abhinav/goldmark-mermaid.
